Redux Steps
step 1- Create a store and give an empty reducer init.
	import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
	export const store = configureStore({
    		reducer : {}, //Giving the empty reducer
		})
step 2- Go to index.js and wrap the application into provider because every
	element has to know the store exists.
	  <React.StrictMode>
    		<Provider store={store}>
      			<App/>
    		</Provider>
  	</React.StrictMode>
step 3- Define the functionality like slicing and slicing is not the
	functionality it is an object.

---------------Now Creating a slice:----------------------
step 1 - firstly declare a initialState. How your state looks when the
	application starts.
step 2 - once the above step is done we have to use a "createSlice" method
	Which is the new method available inside the redux toolkit.
Step 3 - Provide the name to the slice, and then its initial state.
Step 4 - then provide the list of reducers as many as we use and this all
	are in object form.
Step 5 - Then export the reducer as it is given below because it will be
	used in store.
		export default todoSlice.reducer
step 6 - And also export all the methods individually because whereever it
	is required we can use it.

The slicing is Done.
----------Now we have know how to use it--------------

Step 4 - Create a dispatch with useDispatch and then we need to make a 
	communication with the data so we also use useState
step 5 - for this we need to abstract the data and for abstracting the data
	we are using useSelector.
